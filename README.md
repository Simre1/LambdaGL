# LambdaGL

LambdaGL tries to simplify the task of interfacing with OpenGL less difficult by utilising advanced types.

Right now, this project is in its infancy and not usable for any serious application. 

Feel free to check out the code as well as the example.

## Build & Execute Example

I am using stack as my build tool. 

```
git clone https://github.com/Simre1/LambdaGL.git

stack build

stack exec example
```
